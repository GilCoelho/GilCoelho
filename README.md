👋 Hi, I’m @GilCoelho

I'm a Software Engineer in the making for more than 10 years.

Love the job, love the chalange, love the strugle of making a program to work (not only in my machine).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - C/C++ and Python (advance)
  - Ruby and JS (beginner)
  - Docker
  - Leadership
  
- 🏍️ What Drives Me:
  - 🛠️ Building from scratch (code or metal)
  - 🏎️ Anything with wheels, gears, or bits
  - 🧩 Debugging, games, because puzzles are my jam
  - 🎢 Learning for the ride, not just the roadmap
